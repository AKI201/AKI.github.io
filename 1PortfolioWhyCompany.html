        <h1>Why did I choose Cisco for work experience?</h1>
        <span>Cisco plays a large role in the IT industry; many people know what the company does and how they do it. Its name is often associated with reliability, innovation, and influence. </span>
        <br><br>
        <span>Cisco has workers associated with the job role I want to progress into which is full-stack web development. Cisco is a great and reliable company where I can carry out my one day work experience.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>Whether it's through software development, cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, or data analytics, Cisco consistently delivers quality throughout all products.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>In the near future, I hope that I would be accepted into this Cisco branch for my one day work experience to gain some insight and knowledge.</span>
